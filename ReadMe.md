# SalesForce Continuous Integration and Data Pipeline 

## This project is done mostly for fun and learning, but issues and pull requests are welcome!


## What is the purpose of this tool?
**< Some Amazing Name Here >** aims to make migrating changes between salesforce environments simple with integration into VCS. 
 So simple, such that there is no excuse or reason to not do it.
 
### Tasks That kinda work.

- *Quick Deploy from Github to SalesForce* - Take the metadata from a git repo, and put it in a SalesForce instance
- *Migrate Metadata from one instance to another* - Take the metadata from a SFDC instance, and migrate it to another.

### Future Features
- *Migrate Metadata through Instance Environments in sync with git* - Take the metadata from a SFDC instance, and migrate it to another.

- *Provide an Service API to trigger build and migration events from SalesForce* - Managing Metadata items and 
migrations for admins who do not want to deal with git.
